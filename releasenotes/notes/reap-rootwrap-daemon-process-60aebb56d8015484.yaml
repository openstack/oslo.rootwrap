    Reap the rootwrap daemon process after it is timeout and quit. When the
    daemon process is timeout, it will kill itself. But the parent doesn't reap
    it. Fixed this behaviour by adding a thread to wait the process to be done
    once the daemon is started.

    More info please refer the LP #1850241 [1].
