# Add patterns in here to exclude files created by tools integrated with this
# repository, such as test frameworks from the project's recommended workflow,
# rendered documentation and package builds.
#
# Don't add patterns to exclude files created by preferred personal tools
# (editors, IDEs, your operating system itself even). These should instead be
# maintained outside the repository, for example in a ~/.gitignore file added
# with:
#
# git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore'
